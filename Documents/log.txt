[00:00:56]   Node.js 8.x LTS Carbon is no longer actively supported!
[00:00:56] 
[00:00:56]   You will not receive security or critical stability updates for this version.
[00:00:56] 
[00:00:56]   You should migrate to a supported version of Node.js as soon as possible.
[00:00:56]   Use the installation script that corresponds to the version of Node.js you
[00:00:56]   wish to install. e.g.
[00:00:56] 
[00:00:56]    * https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x — Node.js 12 LTS "Erbium"
[00:00:56]    * https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x — Node.js 14 LTS "Fermium" (recommended)
[00:00:56]    * https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x — Node.js 16 "Gallium"
[00:00:56] 
[00:00:56]   Please see https://github.com/nodejs/Release for details about which
[00:00:56]   version may be appropriate for you.
